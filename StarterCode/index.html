          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Health is Wealth! That's a quote by the American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1860. For a nation like the United States of America (U.S.A) 
            that quote captures a long drawn mission statement. Establishing health and wellbeing against the backdrop of significant health risks, preeminently:
            Obesity, Smoking practice and Lack of Healthcare, is a goal that for the U.S.A, it appears, is sectioned into States' rights. How then is each State faring
            when these health risks are correlated with median income, median age and poverty rate, in order to establish the wellbeing and welfare of citizenry?</p>
            
            <p>Well the data in our scatter plot helps to tell the story, and score each State. The chart above is an interactive 'Scatter' plot or chart designed to show the relationship between 3 measured Health Risks on the Y-axis:
            Obesity, Smokers and Lack of Healthcare all measured in percentages, and Poverty, Age and Income on the X-Axis, for each U.S. State. The axis 
            scale adapts to the selected property on each axis and properties' measurements increase along the positive X and Y axes respectively. Hover over 
            each bubble to get more information about the correlation between each risk on the Y-axis and the specific measure on the X-axis. The data tells 
            the story of where each U.S. State is in terms of risks versus poverty, age and income.</p>

            <p>Linger on each State. As you hover over each State, linger long enough to see how each State has fared. We can therefore measure where we are, how far off
              we are from our goal and what each State should decipher from the data. Indeed, numbers don't lie!
