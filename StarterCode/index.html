          <h2><i>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</i></h2>
          <p>Health is Wealth! That's a quote by the American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1860. For the United States of America (U.S.A), that quote captures 
            a long drawn mission statement. Establishing health and wellbeing against the backdrop of significant health risks, preeminently: Obesity, Smoking practice 
            and Lack of Healthcare, is a goal that for the U.S.A, it appears, is sectioned into States' rights. How then is each State faring when these health risks 
            are correlated with median income, median age and poverty rate, in order to establish the wellbeing and welfare of citizenry?</p>
            
            <p>Well the data in our scatter plot helps to tell the story, and score each State. Apparently, the healthiest States have low obesity rates, has better 
              access to health care and less smokers. Massachusetts is in this category and consequently has low poverty rate, with a median age of about 39 years.
            This example is just one of many that the data represented in the chart above helps to establish</p>

            <p>The chart is interactive. As you hover over each State, linger long enough to see how each State has fared. We can therefore measure where we are, how far off
              we are from our goal and what each State should decipher from the data. Indeed, numbers don't lie!
