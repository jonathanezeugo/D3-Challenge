This challenge focuses on analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings.
The goal is to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The visualization will help sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
